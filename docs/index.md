## Mini-game crypto-challenge

Welcome to the crypto-challenge version `v2 machine: nzv-09p6186nnp1781870`

First of all, can you find where the challenge is? All I can say is that the you will run in in the `us-east-1` region.

You also need something from this page. Maybe you read it already. If you need a hint to decypher it... "Julius Caesar, was a Roman dictator..."

When you find the challenge, pay attention to the login messange.

Can you now find the password that decrypts the first file to reveal the hidden message?

Files were encrypted like this:

 - `gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --symmetric --output file01.encrypted file01`

When you find the password for the next file, use the command like this:

 - `gpg --output file{01..05} -â€”decrypt file{01..05}.encrypted`

Then you will be asked for a password. Type it in to decrypt the file and reveal the next hidden message.

Remeber to clear the gpg cache if you put a wrong password.


Note that the AWS or Amazon full names of the services matter in this challenge. Spaces matter. New lines matter. Everything matters!

e.g. "Where would you store object files with 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability?"

Answer: `Amazon Simple Storage Service`


We wish you the best of good luck!

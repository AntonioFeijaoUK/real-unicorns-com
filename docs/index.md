## mini-game crypto-challenge

Welcome to the crypto-challenge version g34m892-nrf.

First of all, cand you find where the challenge is? I can say that is in the `us-west-1` region.

You also need something from this page. If you need a hint.."Julius Caesar, was a Roman dictator..."

When you find the callenge, can you now find the password that decrypt the next file to reveal the hidden message?

Files were encrypted like this:

 - `gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --symmetric --output file01.encrypted file01`

When you find the password for the next file, use the command like this:

 - `gpg --output file{01..05} â€”decrypt file{01..05}.encrypted`

Then you will be asked for a password. Type it in to decrypt the file and reveal the next hidden message. 

Note that the AWS or Amazon full name of the service matters in this challenge.

Spaces matter.

New lines matter.

Everything matters!

e.g.
> "Where yould you store object files with 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability?"

Answer:
> 'Amazon Simple Storage Service'


We wish you the best of good luck!
